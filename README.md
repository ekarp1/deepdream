# deepdream
Creates sequences of increasingly "dream-like" images.

This is highly based on the following tutorials for deepdream:
https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/deepdream.ipynb
https://pythonprogramming.net/deep-dream-python-playing-neural-network-tensorflow/

This implementation of deepdream works well with the latest version of tensorflow for python 3.7. 
It requires the python modules pillow, tensorflow, matplotlib, and numpy.
